<h3> About me
At the moment I am working in a completely different area, I am a senior tax consultant. I am self-motivated, adaptable, having an eye for detail. Learning UI/UX design helped me realize that I like coding and I want to try myself on it.
<h3> Skills
* JS
* React
* Git
* Figma
<h3> Code Example
```
switch (true) {
    case randomNumber < 20:
        console.log('randomNumber more than 20');
        break;
    case randomNumber > 50:
        console.log('randomNumber more than 50');
        break;
    default:
        console.log('randomNumber more than 20, and less than 50');
}
```
